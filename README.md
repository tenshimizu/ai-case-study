## A Case Study of AI in the Air Traffic Management Industry

In the last 7 years there have been an average of 31.9 million commercial flights globally <sub>(1)</sub>. And that number is increasing year over year as airports become more efficient, airlines expand their flight options, and new airlines are started to meet the travel demands of the global populations. In 2016 Nicholas Bulcao and Ryan Rusnak founded a company designed "to help the world's most challenging air missions succeed across commercial, defense, and national security operations" <sub>(2)</sub> and thus Air Space Intelligence was formed. 

Air Space Intelligence (ASI) is a privately held company with a customer base of both "the major commercial airlines and the U.S. Air Force" <sub>(3)</sub>, industries that are valued at over $500B <sub>(4,5)</sub>. They are funded through venture capital investments and since 2020 they have raised a total of $53M through two rounds of funding <sub>(6,7)</sub>. Their primary product, Flyways AI, was inspired by a trip in 2018 where the founders were invited to visit an air operations center. 
>"They expected to see Star Trek-like mission control systems. Instead, they encountered green screens, paper-printed weather charts, and 120-page manuals for application usage" <sub>(8)</sub>. 

What sets Flyways AI, and therefore ASI, apart from its competitors is two fold: a Comprehensive Ecosystem Analysis and 4D Mapping and Predictive Models. The Comprehensive Ecosystem Analysis within Flyways AI is designed to evaluate all scheduled and active flights within the entire system. Using this system wide evaluation instead of focusing on an individual flight, Flyways AI is able to recommend the most optimal flight path, avoiding both adverse weather and traffic congestion on the ground and in the sky. The 4D Mapping and Predictive Models provide "dynamic visualization of airspace conditions and predicts how weather, congestion, and other factors will evolve, offering actionable recommendations for dispatchers and pilots" <sub>(9)</sub>. 

The Air Traffic Management (ATM) field is an industry plagued by technological stagnation. Over the last 5-10 years there have been no major innovations in the field. All innovations and progress have been directed towards improving plane safety and how to deal with the unprecedented increase of unmanned aircraft, both military and civilian. The ATM industry is a global industry and therefore there are many companies within the field, according to an analysis found on marketsandmarkets.com the top five major companies within the ATM field are: Thales Group (France), Raytheon Technologies Corporation (US), L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (US), Indra Sistemas, S.A. (Spain) and Saab AB (Sweden)<sub>(10)</sub>. 

ASI has made their mark in the industry by performing a 6 month trial of their Flyways AI in partnership with Alaska Airlines. Within the trial, the AI "reduced fuel use on 64% of flights it evaluated, saving 480,000 gallons of fuel and avoiding 4,600 tons of carbon emissions" <sub>(11)</sub>. These results demonstrate tangible benefits both environmentally and economically. In addition to commercial airline uses, Flyways AI is designed to assist with military and government needs, specifically to assist in "mission-critical air traffic optimization, providing situational awareness and improving operational logistics for institutions like the U.S. Department of Defense" <sub>(12)</sub>. 

There are many metrics that are used by the FAA to measure efficiency within the ATM field such as: average gate-to-gate times, flown vs. filed flight times, average distance flown between city pairs, average fuel burned between city pairs, and runway incursion rates<sub>(13)</sub>. ASI is utilizing Flyways AI to help other airlines, such as Alaska Airlines, to improve their reported in-field metrics. The results of the trial with Alaska Airlines demonstrates that the application of the AI technology provided by ASI can substantially improve key metrics in both safety and efficiency for commercial adopters.

Moving into the future, ASI should offer commercial oriented AI features that are focused on analyzing, alerting, and helping optimize maintenance on airplanes. This offer of a one stop shop would extend the reach of the airline's efficiency optimizations. So from gate to gate the fleets of the airline industries are being utilized to their peak efficiencies reducing toil and repair costs while increasing fuel savings and the overall lifespan of the planes. This technology would leverage mechanical knowledge, built in mechanical alerts, and conditional real time knowledge to keep track of wear and tear on the plane. As the plane ages and experiences different conditions throughout its service, the AI can potentially identify developing issues and notify the mechanics before it becomes noticeable or damaging.

Overall, ASI has publicly splashed into an industry that has been plagued by stagnation for decades. Showing both the industry and the public the benefits of AI when it is used to support the expertise and experience of the humans that spend their lives ensuring that we can travel the globe in safety.
